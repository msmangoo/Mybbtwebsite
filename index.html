   <h2>What Is It?🧋</h2>    
   <p>
       Bubble tea is a special drink that originated in Taiwan during the 1980's. It was first drank as a sweet milk tea complemented with chewy tapioca pearls. Pearl milk tea is a more common drink people have, but bubble tea can include fruit slushies and juices or different types of teas.

<h3>More About Tapioca Pearls...</h3>
<p2>Tapioca pearls, toppings for bubble tea, are seen as sweet and chewy. These delicious toppings originate from tapioca starch which comes from cassava plant's roots. The starch later is turned into a dough and shaped into little balls. If you want flavouring, you can add flavours such as brown sugar.</p2>
    <h4>Let's Try Making Bubble Tea!!!</h4>
<p4>WARNING: THIS IS THE WAY I MAKE MINE SO DON'T JUDGE CAUSE IT'S KINDA BAD... </p4>
<p5>Ingredients:
1. Litchi Jelly, you can get it at most supermarkets like Nations.
2. Passion Fruit Jam, I also get it at Nations.
3. Ice (why not?).
4. Water, just because.</p5>

    STEPS!!!
</h5>
<p6> First, add in your desired amount of passionfruit jam depending on how sweet you want it. Next, pour in some water about to the height of 3/4 of the cup. After, scoop some of your jelly into your cup and if you want less sweetness, strain the jelly. Finally, plop some ice cubes in and enjoy!!!</p6>
